title: "Tutorial: Using the NBA Rebuild Analyzer"
---

## Overview

This tutorial walks through how to use the `nba_rebuilds` package and its Streamlit applications to:
- Fetch NBA standings data
- Analyze multi-season rebuilds trends
- Predict how long teams may take to return to the playoffs

No prior knowledge of the internal codebase is required.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitchster21/nba_rebuild_project.git
cd nba_rebuild_project
pip install -e .
uv sync
```

## Fetch NBA Standings Data
Standings data can be fetched using the public NBA API or loaded from pre-downloaded CSV files.

To fetch manually:
```bash
uv run python -m nba_rebuilds.fetch_data --start 2010 --end 2023 --type standings
```
This command downloads season standings and saves CSV files under:
```bash
src/nba_rebuilds/data/
```

## Launch Streamlit App 
Run the entire NBA Analytics Suite (both Rebuild Analyzer and Playoff Predictor) with one command:
```bash
uv run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Rebuild Analyzer (Streamlit App)
- Select a range of NBA seasons.
- Preview combined multi-season standings data.
- Aggregate performance metrics by team (**Team Summary**) or view raw season data (**Raw Season Data**).
- Click **Compute Rebuilds** to see detected rebuilds for the selected years.
- **Tip:** Fetching via the NBA API is slow and sometimes restricted; using pre-fetched CSV files in `src/nba_rebuilds/data/` is recommended.


## Playoff Predictor (Streamlit App)
- Estimate how many years a team may take to return to the playoffs based on roster continuity and player features.
- Generate predictions for individual teams or run batch predictions.
- View feature importance to understand model behavior.
- Adjust toggles and filters to experiment with different team indicators.
